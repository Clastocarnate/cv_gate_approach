# CV Gate Approach

This repository contains code and a dataset for detecting the corners of an underwater gate using computer vision techniques. The aim is to preprocess underwater images and apply filtering and thresholding to highlight specific features, making it suitable for underwater navigation tasks.

## Repository Structure

- `frames/`: Directory containing image frames extracted from the underwater footage.
- `blur.py`: Code to apply Gaussian and median blurs to smooth the image and reduce noise.
- `dehazed_footage.mp4`: Sample video footage after dehazing, used for extracting frames.
- `enhanced_image.png`: Enhanced version of an image after applying color balance and contrast enhancement.
- `enhancement.py`: Code to enhance underwater images through color balance, contrast enhancement, and sharpening.
- `frame_007243.png`: Sample frame for testing.
- `get_frames.py`: Code to extract individual frames from the underwater footage.
- `smoothed_image.png`: Output image after applying blurring techniques.
- `test.py`: Code to detect points on a static image.
- `threshold.py`: Code for applying thresholding in YUV color space with trackbars to adjust values dynamically.
- `integration.py`: Main script to enhance images, apply blurring, detect key points, and save processed frames to an output video.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cv_gate_approach.git
   cd cv_gate_approach```

	2.	Install the necessary packages (requires OpenCV and NumPy):

pip install opencv-python-headless numpy



Usage

Frame Extraction

Extract frames from dehazed_footage.mp4:

python get_frames.py

Image Enhancement

Enhance an individual image to improve visibility:

python enhancement.py

Smoothing Image

Apply Gaussian and median blurs to an enhanced image:

python blur.py

Threshold Adjustment in YUV

Use the threshold tool to adjust YUV values interactively:

python threshold.py

Full Integration and Processing

Run integration.py to apply the full processing pipeline, including image enhancement, blurring, and thresholding, with the option to navigate through images and save the output as a video.

python integration.py

Key Functions

	•	Image Enhancement: Balances colors, improves contrast using CLAHE, and applies optional sharpening.
	•	Smoothing: Applies Gaussian and median blurs to reduce noise.
	•	Threshold Adjustment: Interactive adjustment of YUV thresholds for fine-tuning feature detection.
	•	Integration and Video Saving: Combines all processing steps and saves results as a video file for easier visualization.
