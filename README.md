It looks like the issue you’re facing is with the way the Markdown code blocks are formatted in the README file. Let’s correct that formatting to ensure it displays correctly:

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/cv_gate_approach.git
cd cv_gate_approach

2. Install the necessary packages (requires OpenCV and NumPy):

pip install opencv-python-headless numpy

## Usage

### Frame Extraction

Extract frames from `dehazed_footage.mp4`:

python get_frames.py

### Image Enhancement

Enhance an individual image to improve visibility:

python enhancement.py

### Smoothing Image

Apply Gaussian and median blurs to an enhanced image:

python blur.py

### Threshold Adjustment in YUV

Use the threshold tool to adjust YUV values interactively:

python threshold.py

### Full Integration and Processing

Run `integration.py` to apply the full processing pipeline, including image enhancement, blurring, and thresholding, with the option to navigate through images and save the output as a video.

python integration.py

## Key Functions

- **Image Enhancement**: Balances colors, improves contrast using CLAHE, and applies optional sharpening.
- **Smoothing**: Applies Gaussian and median blurs to reduce noise.
- **Threshold Adjustment**: Interactive adjustment of YUV thresholds for fine-tuning feature detection.
- **Integration and Video Saving**: Combines all processing steps and saves results as a video file for easier visualization.
